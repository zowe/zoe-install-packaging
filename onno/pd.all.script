.*  This model assumes that the product will be supplied in the ISC

.*
.*  The following .nameits are required and CANNOT be deleted or

.*     FEATNO  (nameit needs to exist, not content of FEATNO)
.*     REL
.*
.*  The style specified on the :docprof tag MUST be 'ibmpdir'.
.*
.*  If the Program Directory source uses imbeds (.im or .si tags),
.*  each tag must be included in conditional logic so that the Program
.*  Directory will successfully format in Software Delivery and
.*  Fulfillment, where imbedded files will not exist.
.*
.*  ALL SECTIONS INCLUDED IN THIS MODEL ARE REQUIRED to appear in
.*  the finished Program Directory unless the AUTHOR: instructions

.*
.*  When test-formatting this Program Directory, remember that it must

.* INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS
.* ===================================================================
.*
:h1 id=insrqmt.Installation Requirements and Considerations
.*
:p.The following sections identify the system requirements for
installing and activating &PGMNAME..
The following terminology is used:
:ul.
:li.:cit.Driving system:ecit.: the system on which SMP/E is executed to
install the program.
:p.
The program might have specific operating system or product level
requirements for using processes, such as binder or assembly
utilities during the installation.
:li.:cit.Target system:ecit.: the system on which the program is
configured and run.
:p.
The program might have specific product level requirements,
such as needing access to the library of another product for link-edits.
These requirements, either mandatory or optional, might directly
affect the element during the installation or in its basic or
enhanced operation.
:eul.
:p.In many cases, you can use a system as both a driving system
and a target system.
However, you can make a separate IPL-able clone of
the running system to use as a target system.
The clone must include copies of all system
libraries that SMP/E updates, copies of the SMP/E CSI data sets that
describe the system libraries, and your PARMLIB and PROCLIB.
:p.Use separate driving and target systems in the following situations:
:ul.
:li.When you install a new level of a product that is already installed,
the new level of the product will replace the old one. By installing
the new level onto a separate
target system, you can test the new level and keep the old
one in production at the same time.
:li.When you install a product that shares libraries or load modules
with other products, the installation can disrupt the other products.
By installing the product onto a separate
target system, you can assess these
impacts without disrupting your production system.
:eul.

.*
.*          If your product has programming requirements for the

.*           Read all instructions thoroughly. There are installation
.*           requisite and operational requisite sections with
.*           mandatory and conditional tables for each. Instructions
.*           provided in each section.
.*
.*          The 2 types of requisites are:
.*           INSTALLATION and OPERATIONAL
.*          Each type has two categories:
.*           MANDATORY and CONDITIONAL
.*          There will be 2 tables under each requisite category
.*          as follows:
.*          INSTALLATION                 OPERATIONAL
.*          -------                      -----------
.*            MANDATORY                    MANDATORY
.*            CONDITIONAL                  CONDITIONAL
.*
.*  INSTALLATION/OPERATIONAL - MANDATORY REQUISITES
.*     The following applies to ALL MANDATORY REQUISITES:
.*
.*     The product identified as MANDATORY will be required for your
.*     product to either INSTALL or OPERATE its basic function(s)
.*
.*     Consequences:
.*          When ordering a system-replacement offering (such as
.*          SystemPac or ServerPac), a customer WILL NOT BE
.*          PERMITTED to order this product unless all requisites in
.*          this category are satisfied WITHIN THE SAME ORDER.
.*          Naturally, the customer must obtain a valid license for
.*          such requisite products.
.*
.*          When ordering a product-replacement offering, the
.*          customer will receive a warning message (but the order
.*          will be permitted) unless all requisites in this
.*          category are satisfied within the same order.  In this
.*          case, it is assumed that the customer already has, or
.*          will obtain via other means, the requisite products.
.*
.*          NOTE: Products that do not install on the z/OS platform
.*          cannot be mandatory requisites.  Non-z/OS platform
.*          requisites, Installation or Operational should be
.*          denoted in the 'Special Considerations' section of
.*          the program directory.
.*
.*          NOTE: The Base product itself, z/OS, DB2, IMS, CICS, NCP,
.*          should only be listed as a Mandatory Installation
.*          Requisite if your product CANNOT install without it.
.*          If you are listing it because of CALLLIBs, instead ensure
.*          your DDDEF job and your program directory explain the
.*          need for them. Else, having the Base product as a Driving
.*          System requisite should be sufficient. Since Base products
.*          cannot be in Product ServerPac, a mandatory installation
.*          requisite for it can impact your eligibility in Product
.*          ServerPac.
.*
.*          NOTE: If the SMPMCS specifies a required function on its
.*          ++VER statement using the REQ, PRE, or FMID operands,
.*          the required function must be installed into the same
.*          SMP/E zones as the requiring function.
.*
.*  INSTALLATION/OPERATIONAL - CONDITIONAL REQUISITES
.*     The following applies to ALL CONDITIONAL REQUISITES:
.*     (CONDITIONAL = previous FUNCTIONAL)
.*
.*     The product identified as CONDITIONAL will be required for your
.*     product to either INSTALL ie./ without warning messages,
.*     resolve CALLLIBS, etc. or OPERATE at run time ie./utilize
.*     specific function
.*
.*
.*     Consequences:
.*          The customer will receive a warning message (but the order
.*          will be permitted) unless all requisites in this category
.*          are satisfied within the same order.  In this case, it is
.*          assumed that the customer does not intend to use
.*          the specific function or (for product-replacement
.*          offerings) already has, or will obtain via other means,
.*          the requisite products.
.*
.*   NOTE: You should not require a product that has already ended
.*         service or is going out of service within one month from
.*         your product's GA.

.* TARGET SYSTEM LIBRARIES TABLES
.* ===================================================================
.*
.* AUTHOR:  Use the following tables to show the estimates necessary
.*          for a first-time user to install the program.
.*
.*          The "Target Libraries" and "Distribution Libraries" tables
.*          must be used for all products.  The other tables are only
.*          required if they apply to the product and if your product's
.*          installation requires values other than the defaults;
.*          otherwise, the tables can be deleted or commented out.
.*
.*          The "SMP/E Work Data Sets" and "SMP/E Data Sets" tables
.*          should only be used if a data set uses an unusual amount
.*          of space.  If you have no exceptional requirements for
.*          any of the data sets in a table, leave the table commented
.*          out.  If you do have exceptional requirements for one or
.*          more data sets, uncomment only enough of the table to
.*          document the affected data set(s).
.*
.*          FOR ALL TABLES:
.*            Create a :row for each line desired in each table.
.*            Replace the question marks in the lines below with:
.*               -- The DDNAME of the library (either alone, such as
.*                  SABCMODS, or with a recommended HLQ specified,
.*                  such as HLQ.SABCMODS.
.*               -- Type of library (U, S, or E)
.*               -- The ORG of the library (PDS, PDSE, or SEQ)
.*               -- The RECFM of the library
.*               -- The LRECL of the library (NOTE: for RECFM=U data
.*                  sets, LRECL must be 0)
.*               -- The number of 3390 tracks needed to contain the
.*                  product
.*               -- The number of directory blocks needed to contain
.*                  the product (NOTE: for PDSEs, place "N/A" in this
.*                  column)
.*
.*          Add or delete lines as appropriate.
.*
.*          Make sure that the data set sizes specified contain 15%
.*          extra space.  It is also recommended that the number of
.*          directory blocks contain 40% extra space.
.*
.*          Make sure that no commas appear in numeric values.
.*
.*          Please also document any unusual conditions concerning
.*          any of these libraries, such as:
.*
.*           - Libraries required for IPL
.*
.*           - Libraries whose names cannot be changed
.*
.*           - Libraries which must have an HLQ of SYS1.
.*
.*           - Libraries which must be in the master catalog
.*
.*           - Libraries which must be allocated contiguously
.*
.*           - Libraries which cannot be allowed to allocate extents
.*
.*           - Libraries to be used as input to the linkage editor
.*             (they must be blocked no larger than 3200)
.*
.*           - Libraries which need to double space (if they contain
.*             macros and delete previous levels)
.*
.*           - Libraries that are C/C++ should be noted here as they
.*             are allocated.  For example:
.*             Target Library SABCH is allocated as SABCH.H

:p.The following figures describe the target and distribution libraries
and file system paths
required to install &PGMNAME..  The storage requirements of &PGMNAME.
must be added to the storage required by other programs that have
data in the same library or path.
:note.Use the data in these tables to determine which libraries can be
merged into common data sets.  In addition, since some
ALIAS names may not be unique, ensure that no naming conflicts will be
introduced before merging libraries.

.* ===================================================================
.* TARGET SYSTEM TARGET LIBRARIES TABLE
.* ===================================================================
.*
.* AUTHOR:  There are two columns specific to the "Target Libraries"
.*          Table.
.*
.*     - "Member Type" indicates what type of members reside in the
.*        library so that customers know what data sets can be merged.
.*        If a library contains more than one type, all types should be
.*        listed.  The valid types are:
.*        CLIST, Data, EXEC, Font, Help,
.*        LMOD, Macro, Message (MSG), Panel (PNL), Procedure (PROC),
.*        Sample (SAMP), Skeleton (SKEL), Book, Source, Table, Text,
.*        FORMDEF, PAGEDEF, Overlay, and PSEG.
.*        NOTE:
.*        These member types are not required
.*        to match the SMP/E element types defined in the SMPMCS.
.*
.*     - "Target Volume" indicates which volume the data set should
.*        reside on.  The value in this column must be TVOL1 if the data
.*        set must reside on TVOL1, or ANY if this is not necessary.
.*        TVOL1 is the SYSRES volume, so only data sets required at IPL
.*        time should be required to reside there.
.*
.*        If the value is TVOL1, then TVOL1 must also be identified in
.*        the allocation and DDDEF jobs.

.*          chapter must document the entire SMP/E installation;
.*          separate Installation Guides are not allowed for any
.*          part of the SMP/E installation.
.*
:p.This chapter describes the installation method and the step-by-step
procedures to install and to activate the functions of &PGMNAME..
.*
:p.Please note the following points:
:ul.
:li.If you want to install &PGMNAME. into its own SMP/E environment,
consult the SMP/E manuals for instructions on creating and initializing
the SMPCSI and the SMP/E control data sets.
:li.You can use the sample jobs that are provided to perform part or all
of the installation tasks.  The SMP/E jobs assume that all DDDEF entries
that are required for SMP/E execution have been defined in appropriate
zones.
:li.You can use the SMP/E dialogs instead of the sample jobs to
accomplish the SMP/E installation steps.

.*If you have received this product from customized offerings, go to
.*:hdref refid=smpreq..
.*
.*:h3.SMP/E Considerations for Using the SMP/E Web Download
.*:p.The SMP/E Web download package for &PGMNAME. is packaged using the
.*SMP/E GIMZIP function, which was introduced in SMP/E for z/OS V3.1.
.*Although GIMZIP and GIMUNZIP are used for the packaging, the full
.*SMP/E RECEIVE FROMNETWORK function is not available with this package.
.*The SMP/E GIMUNZIP function is required to process the downloaded
.*package. See the z/OS SMP/E Reference for information about using
.*GIMZIP and GIMUNZIP. Ensure that you meet the driving
.*system requirements as documented in Driving System Requirements.
.*
.*:p.Perform the following tasks:
.*:ol.
.*:li.Ensure that the configuration requirements for using GIMUNZIP
.*are completed. For a description of the GIMZIP and GIMUNZIP
.*functions, see the SMP/E web page at
.*http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/smpe/.
.*
.*:li.Allocate a R/W file system directory on the z/OS system where
.*the package will be staged. The R/W file system directory is the
.*repository for the download package.
.*:li.Download the Web package from the following
.*Website:
.*http://???.???.???
.*The package contains two parts:
.*:ol.
.*:li.-shortname-.README.txt
.*:p.This file contains a sample job that performs the following tasks.
.*You must update this file to reflect your environment. Make sure this
.*file is transferred from the download site as a text file.
.*:ul.
.*:li.Executes the UNIX System Services pax command
.*of z/OS UNIX System Services to extract the GIMZIP archives from
.*the download package.
.*:li.Executes the GIMUNZIP program to expand the GIMZIP
.*archives and places their contents in data sets that can
.*be processed by SMP/E.
.*:li.Executes the SMP/E RECEIVE from DASD function to receive
.*the FMID.
.*:eul.
.*:li.-shortname-.pax.Z
.*:p.This pax archive file contains the SMP/E MCS and the associated
.*RELFILEs. You must download this pax archive file to a node that has
.*connectivity to be downloaded to a node that has connectivity to the
.*target z/OS system. Transfer the file to the host using binary
.*format.
.*:eol.
.*:li.Run the sample job in -shortname-.README.txt.
.*This job will perform the required tasks up to and including the
.*SMP/E RECEIVE from DASD step.
.*:li.Complete the installation by using the instructions in this
.*program directory.

.*
.* AUTHOR:  This table must have a :row for each job.  Use as many rows
.*          as you need, and delete or comment out the rest.
.*
.*          The "Job Type" field contains a keyword to identify the
.*          task performed by the job.  There are seven meaningful
.*          keywords, which must be used as appropriate:  ALLOCATE,
.*          ALLOMZFS, MKDIR, DDDEF, RECEIVE, APPLY, and ACCEPT.
.*
.*          Three additional keywords have been added in 2011 that
.*          are included for Installation Manager (IM) installs:
.*          ALLOCIM, INSTALL, and UNINSTAL. These fields are
.*          commented out.
.*
.*          The validation process depends on the accuracy of this
.*          column.  The RECEIVE job row has been commented out.  If
.*          you are supplying a sample RECEIVE job, uncomment out the
.*          row and update appropriately.
.*
.*          The ALLOCATE and DDDEF jobs are required unless the
.*          allocations and DDDEF jobs for all of the product's data
.*          sets have been shipped in a required product.  The other
.*          sample jobs are optional.
.*
.*          If a job does something other than one of these nine
.*          functions, you may put whatever you want in this column
.*          (other than one of the nine keywords), and the validation

including http://service.software.ibm.com/holdata/390holddata.html.
The latest HOLDDATA may identify HIPER and FIXCAT APARs for the FMIDs
you will be installing.  An APPLY CHECK will help you determine if any
HIPER or FIXCAT APARs are applicable to the FMIDs you are installing.
If there are any applicable HIPER or FIXCAT APARs, the APPLY CHECK will
also identify fixing PTFs that will resolve the APARs, if a fixing PTF
is available.
:p.You should install the FMIDs regardless of the status of unresolved
HIPER or FIXCAT APARs.  However, do not deploy the software until the
unresolved HIPER and FIXCAT APARs have been analyzed to determine their
applicability.  That is, before deploying the software either ensure
fixing PTFs are applied to resolve all HIPER or FIXCAT APARs, or ensure
the problems reported by all HIPER or FIXCAT APARs are not applicable
to your environment.
:p.To receive the full benefit of the SMP/E Causer SYSMOD Summary
Report, do :hp1.not:ehp1. bypass the PRE,
ID, REQ, and IFREQ on the APPLY CHECK.
The SMP/E root cause analysis identifies the cause only of
:hp1.errors:ehp1. and not of :hp1.warnings:ehp1. (SMP/E treats
bypassed PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ conditions as warnings, instead of
errors).
:p.Here are sample APPLY commands:

:li.To ensure that all recommended and
critical service is installed with the FMIDs, receive the latest
HOLDDATA and use the APPLY CHECK command as follows

:p.Some HIPER APARs might not have fixing PTFs available yet.
You should analyze the symptom flags for the unresolved HIPER APARs to
determine if the reported problem is applicable to your environment and
if you should bypass the specific ERROR HOLDs in order to continue
the installation of the FMIDs.
:p.This method requires more initial research, but can provide
resolution for all HIPERs that have fixing PTFs available and are not
in a PE chain.
Unresolved PEs or HIPERs might still exist and require
the use of BYPASS.
:li.To install the FMIDs without regard for unresolved HIPER APARs,
you can add the BYPASS(HOLDCLASS(HIPER))
operand to the APPLY CHECK command. This will allow you to install FMIDs
even though one or more unresolved HIPER APARs exist.  After the FMIDs
are installed, use the SMP/E REPORT ERRSYSMODS command to identify
unresolved HIPER APARs and any fixing PTFs.

.*
:h3.Perform SMP/E ACCEPT
.*
.*
.* AUTHOR:  Update ???ACCEP to match the the name of the ACCEPT
.*          job in the table above as well as any expected return
.*          codes and messages from the ACCEPT CHECK and ACCEPT.
.*          If this product does not ship an ACCEPT job, delete or
.*          comment out the following paragraph and uncomment the
.*          one following.
.*
.*          Chose one of the 2 'Expected return Codes and messages'
.*          that best fits your needs and comment or delete out the
.*          other.
.*
.* ---- MARK - updated sentence re ACCEPT jobname (f3)
:p.Edit and submit sample job &ZJOBACPT. to perform an SMP/E ACCEPT
CHECK for &PGMNAME..  Consult the instructions in the sample job for
more information.
.*
.*:p.Perform an SMP/E ACCEPT CHECK for &PGMNAME..
.*
:p.To receive the full benefit of the SMP/E Causer SYSMOD Summary
Report, do :hp1.not:ehp1. bypass the
PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ on the ACCEPT CHECK.
The SMP/E root cause analysis
identifies the cause of :hp1.errors:ehp1. but not
:hp1.warnings:ehp1. (SMP/E treats bypassed PRE, ID, REQ, and IFREQ
conditions as warnings rather than errors).
.*
:p.Before you use SMP/E to load new distribution libraries, it is
recommended that you set the ACCJCLIN indicator in the distribution
zone. In this way, you can save the entries that are produced from JCLIN
in the distribution zone whenever a SYSMOD that contains inline JCLIN
is accepted. For more information about the ACCJCLIN indicator, see the
description of inline JCLIN in the SMP/E Commands book for details.
.*
:p.After you take actions that are indicated by the ACCEPT CHECK, remove
the CHECK operand and run the job again to perform the ACCEPT.
:note.The GROUPEXTEND operand indicates that SMP/E accepts all requisite
SYSMODs.  The requisite SYSMODS might be applicable to other functions.
.*
:p.:hp2.Expected Return Codes and Messages from ACCEPT CHECK::ehp2.
You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.
.*
:p.If PTFs that contain replacement modules are accepted, SMP/E
ACCEPT processing will link-edit or bind
the modules into the distribution
libraries.  During this processing, the Linkage Editor or Binder might
issue messages that indicate unresolved external references, which will
result in a return code of 4 during the ACCEPT phase. You can ignore
these messages, because the distribution libraries are not executable
and the unresolved external references do not affect the executable
system libraries.
.*
:p.:hp2.Expected Return Codes and Messages from ACCEPT::ehp2.
You will receive a return code of 0 if this job runs correctly.
.*:p.:hp2.Expected Return Codes and Messages from ACCEPT if no PTFs

.*
:h3.Run REPORT CROSSZONE
.*
:p.The SMP/E REPORT CROSSZONE command identifies requisites
for products that are installed in separate zones.  This command
also creates APPLY and ACCEPT commands in the SMPPUNCH data set.
You can use the APPLY and ACCEPT commands to install those cross-zone
requisites that the SMP/E REPORT CROSSZONE command identifies.
.*
:p.After you install &PGMNAME., it is recommended that you run
REPORT CROSSZONE against the new or updated target and distribution
zones.  REPORT CROSSZONE requires a global zone with ZONEINDEX entries
that describe all the target and distribution libraries to be reported
on.
.*
